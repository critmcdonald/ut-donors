title: "Combining donor lists"

We are starting with an Excel spreadsheet that has three sheets. The file was downloaded from `https://utexas.app.box.com/s/b6jzw3p7tvdc02x14pcefdmvqk056tex/file/349382799454`, but the file was renamed `donors.xlsx` and the sheets are names `part1`, `part2` and `part3`.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
part1 <- read_excel("data-raw/Donor_History_responsive - no id.xlsx", sheet = "Part 1")
part2 <- read_excel("data-raw/Donor_History_responsive - no id.xlsx", sheet = "Part 2")
part3 <- read_excel("data-raw/Donor_History_responsive - no id.xlsx", sheet = "Part 3")
```

Merge the three files:

```{r}
combined <- rbind(part1, part2, part3) %>% 
  mutate(DONATION_DATE = dmy(DONATION_DATE))
```

Export as csv
```{r}
combined %>% write_csv("data-done/donors.csv")
```
